<p>This option activates an internal automated grading calculation
based on the compilation of entered information units. This grade
is essentially based on the exhaustiveness of the association and
meta-information feeds from part of the students. More covered the
project plan is, higher will be the grade.</p>

<p>The autograde is calculated on a three index basis :</p>

<ul>
<li>The first index is the "association rate". Ideally, any
requirement should have a path linking to at least one deliverable.
Moreover, any deliverable should have at least one path back to
requirements. This index counts the amount of final entities, and
the amount of unlinked (orphans) entities. If the latter is null,
this index should give the maximum grade.</li>

<li>The next index is the completion index, based on the propagated
task completion indexes up to requirements.</li>

<li>The last index works on the task balancing between members.
Three quarters of the index is given by the rate of assigned tasks
over total task definition. The remainder is given by the balancing
of expected costs. A well balance work distribution will give the
highest score. A more unbalanced distribution will give less.</li>
</ul>

<p>The three crieria are then meaned with equal weights.</p>
