<p>Tasks are performed in order to produce some concrete parts of
the project's goal. These identified products are so called
"deliverables".</p>

<p>This selector allows designating the deliverables the current
task is responsible of.</p>

<p>By mapping such entities, you will allow some indicators being
propagated through the project data model, allowing, as an example,
to display the completion rate of some deliverables based on task
completion analysis.</p>
