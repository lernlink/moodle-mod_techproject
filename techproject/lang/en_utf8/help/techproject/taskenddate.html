<p>A deadline can be set for a task. This deadline MUST be
consistant with task start date against task estimated duration
:</p>

<ul>
<li>If start date is defined, deadline cannot occur before the
start date summed with expected duration.</li>

<li>If start date is not enabled, it will nevertheless be
calculated automatically as deadline minus the expected duration (0
as default for duration).</li>

<li>If the task is assigned to a dated milestone, deadline cannot
overcome milestone deadline.</li>

<li>Deadline cannot overcome project end date.</li>
</ul>
