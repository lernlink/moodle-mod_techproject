<p>This qualifier tells in which state the task is. Task life cicle
will occur changing from state to state. In step 1, task status
changing is free.</p>

<p>The default status set can be changed altering database, or
setting a new value set for that project instance.</p>

<p>Default values are :</p>

<ul>
<li><b>PLANNED:</b> task is scheduled (with or without dates).</li>

<li><b>STARTED:</b> task is on work.</li>

<li><b>BLOCKED:</b> something externally blocks our work. We wait
for issue resolution.</li>

<li><b>DELAYED:</b> we decided to suspend our work for this
task.</li>

<li><b>COMPLETE:</b> task is complete. No more work to do.</li>
<li><b>ABANDONED:</b> task is over. No more work to do and result is not significant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2 may add some formal "workflow" feature for managing task
life cycle control.</p>
