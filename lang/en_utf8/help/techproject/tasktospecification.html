<p>Task can be designated as realizing some subset of
specifications. A single task may realize multiple specifications,
if defined as a rather general task (e.g. : "make that software
component" is a quite undetailed task definition that can realize
an entire set of detailed specifications for that module).
Conversely, a set of tasks may be implied in the realization of a
single specification entry.</p>

<p>This selector allows mapping the current task to multiple
specification entries.</p>

<p>By mapping such entities, you will allow some indicators being
propagated through the project data model, allowing, as an example,
to display the completion rate of some specifications based on task
completion analysis.</p>
