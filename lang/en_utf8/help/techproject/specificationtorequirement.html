<p>This selector maps current specification to relevant
requirements, according to the following semantic.</p>

<p><i>"Specification X is a description of the functional and/or
technical solution that accomplishes the requirement Y"</i></p>

<p>Here the selection is multiple : An undetailed specification can
realize a whole set of requirements. E.g., specifying existance of
an authentication unit could induce following accomplishments :</p>

<ol>
<li>user inditity requirement.</li>

<li>login/password authnetication.</li>

<li>roles abstraction definition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Conversely, a set of detailed specification could be needed to
describe a less detailed requirement.</p>
