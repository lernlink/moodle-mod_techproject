<p>A milestone can be given a deadline.</p>

<p>If this deadline is enabled, the dated milestone becomes an
"official" phase of the activity module, and the assessment
strategy may use them for calculating late indicators.</p>

<p>Deadline cannot be set before project starts, nor overcome the
project's end. Project end is considered as a built in phase, in
addition of any dated milestone.</p>

<p>The list ordering in the GUI being an ergonomic facility,
consistency of deadline sequence is not verified when moving
milestones up and down. Step 2 will reinforce signalling about such
inconsistencies.</p>
