<p>"Effective" entities are those that are not splitted into
subbentites (leaves). They are "terminal" elements of the project,
i.e., elements that designate an "effective" work to perfom.</p>

<p>As an example, if a task A is splitted into two tasks B and C
performing B and C will realize A. The real work which has to be
done is the work defined by B and C. Here we conclude those tasks
are "effective".</p>

<p>This definition can be generalized to the entire entity set
managed by the project manager: Final requirements can also be
qualified as "effective", thus being those on which the final
delivery checkup will concentrate its sight.</p>
