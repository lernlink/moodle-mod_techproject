<p>This qualifier qualifies severity of a specification, i.e., the
importance it will have in the final delivery.</p>

<p>A severe specification will produce some deliverables that are
highly expected. Such features are central objectives of the
project itself. Severity is usually linked to the strength given to
relevant requirements. But in some cases, severity could be a
technical recommandation, out of care of the final customer.</p>

<p>Less severe specifications will continue to be negotiable,
although lack of them will always pull the final delivery to lower
quality.</p>
