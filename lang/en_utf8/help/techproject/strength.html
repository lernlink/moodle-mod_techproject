<p>This qualifier allows defining some "strength" of a requirement,
i.e., some measurement of the importance the customer attached to
this requirement.</p>

<p>Strong requirements will be no negociable parts of the project.
They are usually central topics for which the project is
launched.</p>

<p>Lighter requirements might be subject to adaptation or even
negociation, if staff or skills appear being unsufficiant after
project started.</p>
