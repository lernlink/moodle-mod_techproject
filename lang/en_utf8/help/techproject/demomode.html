<p>This specific demonstration mode is activated by the module
configuration, when guest editing is allowed.</p>

<p>Guest will only be able to write in the "all users" workplace,
and will only view eventual explicit grouped workspaces.</p>

<p>Guests will be affected as students are by the edition rules
setup in module configuration for each entity.</p>
